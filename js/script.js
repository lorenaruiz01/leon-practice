//EASY
// create a variable and assign it a number
    let num = 1

//minus 10 from that number
    num = num - 10

//print that number to the console
    console.log (num)
        //log(num): here, log is a function and num is an argument, meaning you can pass a variable into a function as an argument

//MEDIUM
        //create a variable that holds a value from the input


//add 25 to that number

//alert that number
